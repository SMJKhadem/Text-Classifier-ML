Wave Ya Hand if you if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave Ya Hand if you if you look good
Anyway but you look good
Wave Ya Hand if you if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave Ya Hand if you if you look good
Anyway but you look good

[Verse 1:]
Now tell them b**** anyway
'Cause we don't care what none of them golopies say
You can't stop me, I'mma fulfil my prophecy
I do it, did it, the proper way
I might pop-a-tay,Know which way we operate
Bottles on ice, the bottles is on ice
the VIP lights is hittin' us just right
So if you gettin' money just throw it up in the air
Your hands in the air, like I was your puppeteer
'Cause I, I, I, I am Zolanski
Some call me Barbie, yes im life size
Yes I am humble, yes but why lie 
I am the reason why these girls go bye bye

[Chorus:]
Wave Ya Hand if you if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave Ya Hand if you if you look good
Anyway but you look good
Wave Ya Hand if you if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave Ya Hand if you if you look good
Anyway but you look good

[Verse 2:]
OK, now this right here
To get me in trouble
'Cause when I say i ball i dont mean in a huddle 
I'm always in a Lamb, I never do nothin' subtle
'Cause It's Pink Friday Hoe thats there rebuttal
My 2 guns up, lets blaze it, lets go
I keep a lot of money up in the Escrow
And when I'm at the game I'm in the best row
I am the baddest bitch up in the pet store
'cause I, I, I am Onika
And these shoes hear me, Fashionista
'cause these don't come out til its Easter
I'm VIP bound with Leighton Meester 

[Chorus:]
Wave Ya Hand if you if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave Ya Hand if you if you look good
Anyway but you look good
Wave Ya Hand if you if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave Ya Hand if you if you look good
Anyway but you look good

[Chorus:]
Ah ya ya ya yaaaa
Ah ya ya ya yaaaa

[Chorus:]
Wave Ya Hand if you if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave Ya Hand if you if you look good
Anyway but you look good
Wave Ya Hand if you if you look good
Throw some shade if you look good
Wave Ya Hand if you if you look good
Anyway but you look good
