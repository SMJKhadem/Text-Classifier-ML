Hello, Charlie (ooh)
Ariana, Normani (ooh)
Uh
Let's go

Baby, I've been feedin' the addiction
Flyin' from there and back, felt like an acrobat
Brown eyed, so I fell into submission
Eager to catch myself, like what the hell?

Now we pull your chain
Just to wake you up, wake you up
Push you 'til you break
Now you're steppin' up, steppin' up, ah, ah

Why are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you?
Why are you only?
Why are you only good to me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I'm bad to you?
Why are you only?
Loving you and hating you is in, depending on the day
Tell me why are you only good to me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I'm bad to you?
Why are you only?

Stopped thinking like a victim
This time, I'll throw it back
Boy, can you handle that?
Got you trippin', gave you no attention
That's when I figured out what you're about

Now we pull your chain
Just to wake you up (yeah), wake you up (yeah)
Push you 'til you break
Now you're steppin' up, steppin' up, ah, ah

Why are you only good to me (hey)
When I'm bad to you?
Why are you only?
Why are you only good to me (yeah, yeah, yeah) (uh)
When I'm bad to you? (So bad)
Why are you only?
Loving you and hating you is in, depending on the day
Tell me why are you only good to me (yeah, yeah, yeah)
When I'm bad to you?
Why are you only? (Ayy, yo)

Why you only nice when I get bad, boy? Cha
Get back on your job like you employed, boy, cha
You know that I'm saucy, got that sauce, soy, cha
I ain't 'bout to stay up on this merry-go-round and round
'Cause we go 'round and 'round
But I don't want no clowns around me (brrr)
I tell him, "Who is you cuffin'?"
I got him huffin' and puffin'
He keep on callin' me, "Baby"
Like I'm a bun in the oven (no, no, no)
I said

Why are you only good to me (oh yeah)
When I'm bad to you? (When I'm bad to you)
Why are you only?
Why are you only good to me (oh, oh)
When I'm bad to you? (When I'm bad to you)
Why are you only?
Loving you and hating you is in, depending on the day
Tell me why are you only good to me (so good)
When I'm bad to you?
Why are you only?
