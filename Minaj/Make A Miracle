Feeling dark, gotta see the doctor
It's about my hunger for your heart
And it's your life we could have been through
Angels eyes, it's like heaven inside

As I turn to ask the reason why
As I walk oh woo oh oh, as you walk down by
You can tell me a million lies
As I walk oh woo oh oh oh

Show me to your heart
All I need is you to make a miracle
Ah hey ah ah ah ahah
I need a miracle, a miracle of love

(oh oh oh oh, give me that)

Feeling dark, gotta see the doctor
It's about my hunger for your heart
