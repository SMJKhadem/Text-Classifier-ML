Who said that you weren't beautiful
And that you didn't belong in your own skin?
Who said that you were all alone
And that you're never gonna find love again?

So many little words, so many little lies
That have followed you all of your life
Looking for the truth, look into your eyes
And you'll see it's been there the whole time

Ooh, even when you were running
Even when you were hiding
Never been a moment that you were not perfectly loved
When you barely believed it
When your eyes couldn't see it
Every single moment, you've always been perfectly loved
Ooh, perfectly loved
You've always been perfectly

In the hands of the Infinite
As the wounds of the world became His
See the kindness Heaven has for you
And how He's always been drawing you in

So many open doors (so many open doors), so many miracles (so many)
That have followed you all of your life
Looking for the truth (looking for the truth), look into your eyes (oh)
And you'll see its been there the whole time

Ooh, even when you were running
Even when you were hiding
Never been a moment that you were not perfectly loved
When you barely believed it
When your eyes couldn't see it
Every single moment you've always been perfectly loved
Ooh, perfectly loved
Ooh

You're not a problem
You're not a mistake
Don't need fixing or solving
In the arms of His grace

You're perfectly human
Made from the dust
You've got a heart, broken and scarred, yet perfectly loved

Oh, even when you were running
Even when you were hiding
Never been a moment that you were not perfectly loved
When you barely believed it (when you barely believed it)
When your eyes couldn't see it
Every single moment you've always been perfectly loved
Perfectly loved
You've always been perfectly loved

Ooh
Perfectly loved
You have always been perfectly loved
