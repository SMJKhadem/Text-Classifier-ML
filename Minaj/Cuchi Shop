First, I take their order at the Cuchi Shop (hey)
Then I send 'em a girl that can make her coochie pop (hey)
And then I smuggle all my money through the coochie spot (hey)
(Up in the Phantom, have you wishin' you had 'em, I'm the madam)
And there ain't no returns at the Cuchi Shop (hey)
We don't wanna hear "it burns" at the Cuchi Shop (hey)
Just listen and you'll learn at the Cuchi Shop (hey)
(Up in the Phantom, have you wishin' you had 'em, I'm the madam)

What you need thick thighs and some chinky eyes? (Kyuh)
Super size all your sides like your biggie fries (kyuh)
For a better price you can get some better pie
Strawberry, apple, cherry, even lemon lime
What you want, them B cups? Or them C cups?
For your ice cream, chocolate or butter P cups?
French vanilla threesomes that come in D cups
They eat each other but otherwise they don't eat much
I'm 'bout that fast money, money ain't got no patience (no)
But if them boys come, run like you on probation
Listen up, I'ma send ya to the location
Write it down, take a picture, make a notation

Relax lil' nigga, cut the bull (cut it out)
We tax niggas, no deductible (get it out)
So what it is, what it ain't, nigga, state ya name
You know we got them umbrellas if you make it rain
So what you want, them good girls or them bad ones?
I got them girls make ya wish you never had none
'Cause you'll be spendin' beaucoup in my spot, shorty
This nigga actin' brand new like he just bought it
Up and away like Mighty Mice
You can say I am the rap game Heidi Fleiss
'Cause my flow crazy, Hussein like Sadam
You gettin' it, I got 'em, I'm the rap bitch madam, I'm the madam
