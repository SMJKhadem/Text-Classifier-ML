Aphelliates nigga, pay attention
Hey, hey, hey 
You know it just dawn'd on me
I am Nicki Minaj (ha-ha-ha)

I ain't know the president lived in DC
And I ain't know the called me Nicki Lewinsky
I never knew that dude with Jay was Pimp C
And I ain't no I be with Paris and Lindsey 
I just know that I be on my fly girl shit
A fly girl pop up in a fly girl dip
A fly girl stunt like a fly girl flip
And I don't never guzzle it 
I fly girl sip

Now get that rose' get that get that rose'
A lil' Hennesy and Louis XIII
Now everybody look my way my way
Excuse all the haters 'cause they lookin' sideways

You got me wrong
You be sittin' by da bar when it's your song
You can act like you don't like it but you do
You do, you do (do, do, do, do, do, do)
I think I'm gonna kill da motherfuckin' DJ 
If he don't pull up let da record replay, record replay let that record replay. 
I think I'm gonna kill da motherfuckin' DJ

I ain't know the police was the Babylon 
I ain't know I'm cold just like an avalanche
I never knew my titties were bigger then Pamela
So paparazzi flickin' be flickin' their camera
I just know that I be on my fly girl shit
My fly girl stomach and my fly girl hips
I fly girl ball with my fly girl mitts 
And I can only kiss another fly girl lips

Now get that OJ get that get that OJ
A lil' cranberry and some Remy Monet
Now everybody look my way my way
Excuse all the haters 'cause they lookin' sideways

You got me wrong
You be sittin' by da bar when it's your song
You can act like you don't like it but you do
You do, you do (do, do, do, do, do, do)
I think I'm gonna kill Da motherfuckin' DJ
If he don't pull up let da record replay, record replay, let that record replay 
I think I'm gonna kill da motherfuckin' DJ (oh)
