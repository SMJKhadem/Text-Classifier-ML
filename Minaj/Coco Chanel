Dame la coco, yeah la coco
Ellas quieren coco, y yo tampoco
Never trust a broke hoe, don’t f*ck with po-po
Numero uno, me llama Yoko
Pull up in them thing things, and let them things fling
Niggas know my name ring, and it go “ding-ding”
If I get an inkling, the thing'll sing-sing
Ain't talkin’ 'bout the singer, the thing'll sting-sting

Ayo if I'm in the Gurkha, then they in the back of it
If I tell 'em eat food, then they make a snack of it
If they take your cocaine then they make a crack of it
If they grab your gold chain then they make a plaque of it
Know we never lack on it, run up with the MAC on it
Put a couple racks on it, they gon' put the whack on it
She got the Nicki bundles, worth a stack on it
That's word to Brook' now, that’s word to Bucktown
That’s word to Harlem World, shout out to uptown
You know I shine on 'em, I spray sheen on ’em
That's word to southside, Jamaica, Queens on 'em
I'm mad Queens on ’em, with mad schemes on 'em
I never scale back, the triple beams on 'em
My ice gleams on 'em, Wu-Tang creams on 'em
I pull up on the block bumpin' Biggie "Dreams" on 'em
A nigga greased on 'em, but ice freezed on 'em
I light breezed on 'em, I might breeze on 'em
Might do it like it's Christmas and light trees on 'em
I see the copycats bitin' my steez on 'em

Dame la coco, yeah la coco
Ellas quieren coco, y yo tampoco
Never trust a broke hoe, don’t f*ck with po-po
Numero uno, me llama Yoko
Pull up in them thing things, and let them things fling

If I get an inkling, the thing'll sing-sing
Ain't talkin’ 'bout the singer, the thing'll sting-sting

On a can't tell, dem fi fake vibes
They call me Mrs. Bitch, but I don't miss, bitch
Got real shooters, better D up, guys
Who me? I'm physically fine
Who she? It's like we know she dyin'
Bitch ain't see the board in 2017

All these jealous bitches on the jelly team
Keepin' it a hundred, that's a jelly bean
Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh
