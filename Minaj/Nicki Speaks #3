Okay so I'm just, you know
Briefly run down my shout outs, um
Shoutout to all of the deejays
That's ever showed Nicki Minaj love
I love you right back, um
Shoutout to DJ Holiday, um, you know
Just because he has really nice eyes
And you know he's really sexy and all that
Um, shout out to, my baby Big Mike
And Trap-A-Holics, and, um
Sticks Malone and DJ Infamous and DJ Drama
Um, I also have a very crazy manager
Her name is Debra Antney
And um, she's psychotic, she's bipolar, um
But nevertheless she's mine, all mine
Oh, I have to share her with Gucci Mane
And I have to share her with, OJ Da Juice
And I have to share her with the So Icey Boys
And, you know Waka Flocka Flame and all that but
You know she's all mine anyway
