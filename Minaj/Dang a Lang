I just want him for his hood, cause he do it good, 
The way he make me scream when he give me that thang, 
Throw my face in the pillow now, hey

Call him when I wanna f*ck, say he give me luck, 
When he throw me that pipe I just pack them stacks up 
Throw ma face in the pillow now, hey 
Throw ma face in the pillow now, hey
Dang so damn hood, dang a lang so good 
Like a foot long sub eat it all if you could 
Stomach like a jerk, do his six pack good 
That's all a girl like, I need to feel good 
Already got a car, big house and when I'm done I'm a kick his ass out 
I just want him for his dang a lang, hey
I just want him for his dang a lang, hey 

[Chorus]

Cause dang a lang so pretty, bout 12 inches 
So I let him meet kitty, now they best friends 
I am made good and plenty 
All I want to do is feel that dang a lang in me make him drive it live in me 
Till I swoop like a chimney 
Real hard in me (voice over) 
I make him slim jimmy, better on the remy 
I know the neighbors hear me 
They probably standing ear to wall and whats he doing to me 

Excuse me can I see your dang a lang brother 
I mean you know just juggle your balls like the wrangling brothers 
I'm the harajuku barbie I ain't tripping on your change 
I mean look I got the sports package on my range 
I just dip in the pink for the pink effect 
D-d-d-diamonds on my neck for the link effect 
And I was wondering if I can lip sync on that 
You know my name rings (ting) ring tinkle bells 
Wa-wa-wa-watch (that) 
Chain (check) 
They be on a rain check 
I be on the move 
They be reaching but they can't catch 
I be with the baddest bitch
On the island styling 
Black Miley Cyrus saying hi to pirates 
I be singing them ballads 
When he tossing my salad 
When I pack my palette you see is 
Colorful carrots 
I be singing them ballads 
When he tossing my salad 
When I pack my palette all you see is 
Colorful carrots

[Chorus]

Mi have a yatch, mi have a plane, 
Mi have a whole heap a money in mi name 
Mi just want him fi him dang a lang 
Mi only want him fi him dang a lang 
Mi have many cars, many house, 
Bwoy chat to mi hard, mi kick him ass out 
Mi only want him fi him dang a lang 
Mi just want him fi him dang a lang 

I mean you know, you know, you gotta warn them before you bring,
Bring them to a bad bitch convention Trina, like you cant just do this,
You cant just, pop up and have a whole bunch of bad bitches wit you an,
An you know, we stylin' on these, like c'mon, you know how I mean? 

[Chorus]
