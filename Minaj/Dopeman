Dopeman

Once upon a time, there lived a little bad bitch
I just pressed the buttons on my little gadget
Born in December 'cause I am a Sagit-tarius
Maybe just a little bi-curious
Yo, miney-mo-to-eenie-meenie
Your wish is my command, I mean, I really really mean it

Cause I am the lady that was on "I Dream Of Genie"
They call it spaghetti but I call it linguini
Coke fizzles if you wanna get the sniffles
I got that wet-wet it could get wetter than a drizzle
Plus I got plenty, no seeds in my twenty
And I just got them peanut butter crack sandwiches
You need a dopeman, oh, you need a snowman
I got that Lohan, weight like Rosanne
But fuckin' with my money is a no-no, man
I got them Barbarians, they call me Conan

Dopeman, please can I have another hit
Dopeman, please can I have another hit
Dopeman, please can I have another hit
Dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman
Dopeman, please can I have another hit
Dopeman, please can I have another hit
Dopeman, please can I have another hit

Dopeman, dopeman, dopeman, dopeman
