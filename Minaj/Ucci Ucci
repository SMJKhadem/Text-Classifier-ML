Baby girl, is a diva, certified teaser
I need her, 'cause she a top model like Eva
Could tell she a keeper, I know she got that ether
Put it on me good and have me chargin' up my VISA
(So I) so I hollered at her, went through the procedure
We just got acquainted, told me how to reach her
Keep her hair done in some fresh Gucci pumps
Ass fat like The Klumps, givin' slight goose bumps
She a trophy, standin' 'bout four feet
Smellin' so sweet need to be with a OG
I ain't runnin' no G, baby girl, I know me
Take ya home, make ya moan, we ain't gettin' no sleep
Shawty got me hypnotized from her eyes 
To the size of her thighs compliment her backside
Come and roll with a Chopper City guy
I'ma keep ya fly, have them others knockin' while you rockin' that (come on)

Just 'cause I know they bite my style (okay)
Gucci carry-on and that's for Fido (let's get it now)
Ucci, coochie? Got some good Gucci (yeah)
When I'm on the beach, I got some good Pucci (uh-huh)
See me in the hood like french fries and a two-piece (okay)
When I'm in the club, they Nicki Minaj groupies (word)
Okay, off with your kufi kufi (uh-huh)
You know I got that flavor, call me foofy-foofy (okay)
What you know about the Gucci suit? (Uh-huh)
Gucci coupe, soft top Gucci roof
Listen, I'm that chick (say what?)

She do Gucci, she like Prada
You ain't a Chopper City girl, you get's nada
Tell the waitress to send a couple Rose bottles
Give a couple of models, a couple of swallows
She a superstar like Lupe said
Showing them broke hoes that you get bread
She classy and I like it
She burnin' up and I'm icy
With the Prada glasses and Prada shoes
Shawty, that's what them D-Boy dollars do
I'm Mr. Certified, you a certified quarter
I'm recruitin' for the Dream Team you can be a starter
I'll take you shoppin' for shoes and bags
Steppin' out of Saks with a Down South swag
I can get a hundred grand in a Gucci bag
You the shh, and I'll pop a rubber band on that
