I ain't really finna' tell y'all how to get away with murder and shit

Just the other day I was out in Miami
Got the low-low on them percs
Low-low on them xannies
Nigga's know my bitches petty
I ain't talking mani's
Pull up with a lot of baddies
Don't forget the Addies
When I run up in the town, I ain't chitty chatty
Got some real pretty titties, that come with a fatty
Too much money, I ain't never need a sugar daddy
I'm the belle of the ball, you could call me Patty

I flew in from Trinidad, peep this nigga pressin'
I think that he popped a molly 'cause look how he sweatin'
I'mma let my niggas rob him as soon as it set in
None of you bum bitches can sit with me and Gretchen
It's the biggest
A bitch ain't cough one time
It's the sickest
I don't ever clique up
But they know who the clique is
Fast little bitches, but of course I'm the quickest
Mortal Kombat, ninja Nicki
Who ya pick is?

Ayo Queen, got the customers out here
man, they loving this shit, man
they loving this shit, man
Where you at, man, where you at, man?
We need you here man, I know you out in Miami

Yo, you could take all my bitches out to, Abu Dabi
Let one of my besties confiscate your Maserati
You should throw a party on the yacht for everybody
If we f*ck your shit up, OMG, I'm very sorry
You could call me Barbie, 'cause I look just like a dolly
Yes I bury them when they come for me, call me Halle
Since I finished her, my niggas call me the finale
I'm a busy bitch, I'm filthy rich, no time to polly
Ayo, swerve to the palace
This the queen, f*ck his hollas
Put 15 million dollars, on it
Ask LL, I'm doin' it
Don't get cute and ruin it
All my skill, I hone it
I pity opponents, it look easy, don't it?
(It look easy, don't it?)
(It look easy, don't it?)

Never fakin' it, always makin' it, ya'eard
Iconic shit, man
