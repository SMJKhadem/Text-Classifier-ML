Uh, life on the rocks
Too hard to swallow
So we get high 'til it feel like the sky low
Y'all boys just a bunch of p**** cats milo
Money is the song, pockets on high note
Do ra me fa so
I rock like a fossil, big ball sh-t, Paul Castellano
Shoot ya a** up, now crawl out the condo
That's that nine n****, 'lil rando
Sleeping with the enemy so I f*** the World
To Miss Louise Anna, the sweetest southern girl
The sweetest southern girl
(Sweetest southern girl)

This is times up
Put your signs up
Made em pick my dude
I line up
Baby what the f*** is wrong (wrong) with them
What the f*** is wrong (wrong) with them
You see money you call
Very few are chosen
Looking at the wall
You can feel them close in
Baby what the f*** is wrong (wrong) with them
What the f*** is wrong (wrong) with them

Uh, mind over matter
Money over all
The World is on my shoulders,
Shall I dust my shoulders off?
Uzi rat-a-tatter, knocking over walls
f*** the bulls***, but just don't f*** it raw man
P**** has a pattern and I know where I'm going
And if you got beef I turn into a tenderloin
Sanity kills so I live the crazy life
I wonder if you'll pay attention if I change the price
Life is my wife, till death do us part
Man I'm fly as f*** you ain't even next to depart
Quick draw McGraw, I hope you like art

Stepping on the bulls***
You can be my doormat
Y'all ain't going nowhere with that hatin' s***, four flat
Disrespectful on the beat, Borat
f*** the system and the p**** wasn't all that
Yeah, now time's gettin' shorter
Life on ya head like f***ing read carter now
Don't you cross me, you do better crossing the border
So much money piled up I'm a muthaf***ing hoarder
