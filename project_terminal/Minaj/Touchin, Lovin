Let’s get it
Burrr

No, I ain’t tryna flex, no ceilings you can see who’s in it
If we’re talking about sex, girl, you know that I invented that
And I’m onto the next, that’s unless you bring a friend who with it

Oh, I’m sorry, oh, you mad that I came to the party?
Like, no no no
You took your girl to the club and now she gone, gone, gone
Now she asking me when I’m taking her home, home, home
I tell her “let’s go” long as you know
'Cause I know when we get alone

I’m touchin’ you tonight, I’m lovin’ you tonight (Wait nope)
I’m fuckin’ you, girl, you must be used to spendin’, putting in that time
Touchin’, lovin’, fuckin’, can’t make up my mind
I’m lovin’ you. (Wait nope) I’m fuckin’ you tonight

Girl you fuckin’ with the best
Take a picture while I’m deep up in it
Oh-oh-oh, and if they living right next
Then I bet they know my name in a minute
Let me feel your body sweating, I promise I’ll keep your body dripping

Oh, I’m sorry, oh, you mad that I came to the party?
Like, no no no
You took your girl to the club and now she gone, gone, gone
Now she asking me when I’m taking her home, home, home
I tell her “let’s go” long as you know
'Cause I know when we get alone

I’m touchin’ you tonight, I’m lovin’ you tonight (Wait nope)
I’m fuckin’ you, girl, you must be used to spendin’, putting in that time
Touchin’, lovin’, fuckin’, can’t make up my mind
I’m lovin’ you. (Wait nope) I’m fuckin’ you tonight

Sometimes I tell ‘em I love ‘em because I just wanna f*ck ‘em
I never love ‘em, or cuff ‘em and when we done I’mma duck ‘em
He Ferragamo the buckle, he Louis V on the duffel
The pussy wetter than puddles, I ride his dick like a shuttle
I said real niggas let real bitches cum first
And real bitches been bad bitches from birth
Uh, k-k-kiss him when he cumming
M-m-make more money last year than Mister Drummond
Oh-oh-oh, he like it when I ride it slow

I’m touchin’ you tonight, I’m lovin’ you tonight (Wait nope)
I’m fuckin’ you, girl
You must be used to spendin’, putting in that time
Touchin’, lovin’, fuckin’, can’t make up my mind
Nicki, you know that I love ya, I’m loving you
And I really wanna touch ya, I’m fucking you tonight

(Laughs) What you mean, "wait, no", like... what?!
You better act like you know nigga, it’s Nicki Minaj!
