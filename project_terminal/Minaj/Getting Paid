I don't care what you haters sayin' I'm gettin' paid
I don't care what you haters sayin' I'm gettin' paid
I don't care what you haters sayin' I'm gettin' paid
I'm sayin' I'm gettin' paid
I'm sayin' I'm gettin' paid
Go
I don't care what you haters sayin' I'm gettin' paid
I don't care what you haters sayin' I'm gettin' paid
I don't care what you haters sayin' I'm gettin' paid

If you ain't talkin' money I don't understand your language
It's goin' down, down Barbie
Pushin' a pink Ferrari
I breeze through Africa
Just to see the Safari
I am the baddest bitch
In America
Slicker than a Jerri curl
Just ask Erica
The black Sarah Jessicaaaaa
J-J-J-J-J-J-J-Jessicaaaa

Don't be text messagin' me
I never check my messages
Only thing you could ask me
Is how I want my sandwiches
I want more cheese
Lots and lots of cheese
And when I'm on stage
I'm with SB's
And when you see my luggage
It say LV's
And when I'm on the plane
It's so empty
Hmm, that's why all those female rappers envy
Ha-ha, ha-ha
Oh I'm sorry did she say something? My bad, uh
You know maybe I was booked, I guess I missed ya
You Know, you know when you booked four times a week every week
It's kinda hard to keep track of bum bitches
Hahaha, oh you do the math
It's Barbie bitch!
