That's true, that's right (Uzi)
She's sippin' Moet, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No I'm not a rat, but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie, she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her

Now you beggin' this a doozy
But beggars cannot by choosey
Been the queen for eight summers
Just tell them to call me Suzy
This that Nicki, this that Uzi
This Hennessy got me woozy
Broke the internet in 5411's and some Gucci
The blue ribbons eatin' sushi
It's that real good coochie
This that wet as Chattahoochee
F*ck all y'all like a hoochie
Givin' them bars since the teens
I ain't goin' back to juvie
I am Nicki Yamaguchi
'Cause I skate with the ice
I don't say what's the price
Lookin' like it's a heist
I been winnin' all my life
On a roll, it's a dice
Since that Itty Bitty Piggy
Rep my city like committees
If you fucked it up with Nicki
You feel pretty fuckin' shitty (uh)
Anyway, I'm stoppin' bags like the TSA
Listen up you little bitches, it's a PSA
I'm still shadin' these niggas, yeah the DITA way
You gotta pay me flat bread, yeah the pita way

I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothin' left to give
You'll find another life to live
I know that you'll get over it

Wish I never ever ever told you things
I was only only tryna show you things
Iced out heart on your neck tried to froze your ring
I had to get a me a new bitch to hold the pain
We was in Hawaii lookin' at the ring
Yeah, she smilin' happy, but I'm laughin' 'cause her man's a lame
(Broke boi, broke boi, broke boi, broke boi)
Damn, that just goes to show me money don't attract a thing (real shit)
Stuck to the plan even though you used to go with my mans
(Oh get over it)

I know it hurts sometimes, but you'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
And I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothin' left to give
You'll find another life to live
I know that you'll get over it

See I tied up my RAF you strapped up your Rick
Diamonds on your neck, ice all on my wrist
Complement my style
She don't want me, I'm runnin' wild
You know I respect her on that level
She don't want me then I'ma let her
Go over there with that broke fella
Walk off my Saint Laurent, that leather
My new chick I swear that she better
Want me back, never (ooh)

That's true, that's right
She's sippin' Moet, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No I'm not a rat, but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie, she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her

I know it hurts sometimes, but you'll get over it (woah)
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it (you'll get over it)
I know it hurts sometimes, but you'll get over it (no, no)
You'll find another life to live (you will)
I know that you'll get over it (oh)

You'll get over it
I know that you'll get over it
I know it's over
Check out my cold shoulder (nothin' left to give)
I know its over
Cry on that hoe shoulder (you'll get over it)

We used to be
Kissin' in the tree
'Member it was just you and me
Kissin' in the tree
'Member it was you was just you and me
K-i-s-s-i-n-g
K-i-s-s-i-n-g-e-e-e-e-e-e, uh
