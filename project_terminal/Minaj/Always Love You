I will always love you
Even when I say I don't
I will always see you
Even when my eyes are closed
I'm certain of a lot of things
But with you, I've always known
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
Even if you let me go

Crying about somebody, then tell 'em
Somebody come pass an umbrella, uh
F*ck these bitches, had to tell her
I had to take the call, pass the tele'
I bought you Gucci, baby, Mais' Margiela
You can get a new one, but he won't be better
Straight to the top and don't need no propeller
Oh, I've been all outside with the fellas, ah
Take me back, I can put you in control if you take me back
Goodfella, roll in the new Maybach
She be fucking me good and I'm hooked like crack
Make sure you balling, don't worry 'bout nothing
You keep on going forward and never look back
You bring me love just like 7-Eleven
And just for that I'ma give you some racks
Let ya splurge
Mama, what's the word?
All I do is flirt
Let's do it like a vert
Takin' off your skirt
This the night I make you squirt
Pull up to the telly
Watch me merk you with no dirt
Bet you never need

I will always love you
Even when I say I don't (say I don't)
I will always see you
Even when my eyes are closed
I'm certain of a lot of things 
But with you, I've always known (always known)
I will always love you (always)
I will always love you (love you)
I will always love you (love you)
Even if you let me go

(Even if you let me go)

I never thought you would end up as the enemy
I always thought you'd be right here stood defending me
I feel so bad for you, lost your identity
Made your decision, there's a penalty (Is this so hard)
Is this so hard for me to understand? (So hard for me to understand)
I guess the universe had different plans (I guess the universe had different plans)
I put my love, I put my love in your hands
In your hands

But that was so you
You had to leave, I had to go to
I could always tell that you had no clue
You never understood what I had to go through
But then I guess somewhere deep inside we both knew
So the memories is what I toast to
'Cause in a past life when everything felt right
You used to know me (and I got to know you)

Once upon a time when we rolled out
But now, baby, oh no, you sold out

I will always love you 
Even when I say I don't (when I say I don't)
I will always see you
Even when my eyes are closed (when my eyes are closed)
I'm certain of a lot of things
But with you, I've always known
I will always love you (I love you)
I will always love you (love you)
I will always love you (love you)
I will always love you (love you)
I will always love you (love you)
I will always love you (love you)
Even if you let me go
