Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
I lied, I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart

Even though I said I didn’t love you
I lied, I lied
Even though I said I didn’t need you
I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

Even though I said don’t touch me
I lied, I lied
I can’t fall for you, can’t give my all to you
Can’t let you think that Imma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said let’s see
But I ain’t mean that, I need some fucking proof
'Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose
You just a heart breaker won’t let you break mine
'Cause I’ll be smashing windows and cutting them break lines

I lied
'Cause who knew that if I just let myself go with you
Who knows, who knows, so I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

Even though I said 'f*ck you'
I lied, I lied

I thought eventually you would let me go
That was my insecurities and my ego
Missed my jump shot missed my free throw
Miss the way we kiss miss the d o
Man it was good while it lasted
That shit wasn’t real it was magic
If it was a record it would have been classic
But f*ck you though, orgasmic

I guess this is what I gotta do to keep me from falling
Stalling the truth, who knew what you’d
Do if I let you in
My mama ain't raised no fool, I
I am not your usual typical type
Who would protect me if I never hide?
Falling so fast I am afraid of you, so I lied

I lied, I lied
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh
To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh oh
I lied
Ooh baby
Ooh

'Cause who knew that if I just let myself go with you
