When I kiss you so good (Mario)
Why would you wanna break up? (Gucci, Gucci)
When this lovin' is so good
Why would you wanna break up? (Sean Garrett the Pen)
When I hit that so good
Why would you wanna break up? (Gucci, burr)
When this feelin' is so good
Why would you wanna break up? (We goin' in, oh)

Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
When I'm, when I'm lovin' you, lovin' you
Why would you wanna break up? Do anything for you
Why would you wanna break up?
See I be drivin' through your hood
Why would you wanna break up?

Now baby girl done dumped me, she no longer wants me
I'm no longer hired, she said that I been fired
On to the next one, more fish in the sea
Girls are like buses, miss one, next fifteen, one comin' (huh)
Gucci Mane crazy and his ice game stuntin' (burr)
Swag so stupid still the bitch straight dumped me
Over, no more smokin' doja
Baby girl went AWOL, she used to be my soldier

(Don't) don't I lace you with the Gucci?
(Don't) don't I deck you in the Louis?
(Don't) don't I make your earlobe freeze?
(Don't) don't when I dive, I dive deep?
I know I be (gone) 
I know I be (gone)
I know I be (flirtin' with them girls)
I know I be (sayin' I be right back but take too long)
I know I be (sayin' I'll be faithful but I don't)
I know I be makin' you them promises
Then breakin' your heart again
Tellin' you she wasn't who she was then we arguin'
But baby, I love you (oh)

Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
When I'm, when I'm lovin' you, lovin' you
Why would you wanna break up? Do anything for you
Why would you wanna break up?
See I be drivin' through your hood
Why would you wanna break up?
Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
When I'm, when I'm lovin' you, lovin' you
Why would you wanna break up? Do anything for you
Why would you wanna break up?
See I be drivin' through your hood (Gucci)
Why would you wanna break up?

Hmm
Yep, the Barbie p-p-pushin' her Ferrari
You was wildin' like safaris now you s-s-s-s-sorry
But I'm not listenin', not listenin', not listenin-in'
'Cause I b-b-b-b-ball, I got gentlemen whistlin'
I got the referee makin' all kind of calls
'Cause they be sweatin' me like NBA player balls
Now you cryin', nose all stuffy
I told you, you was lucky, now I'm the bride of Chucky
Nicki (oh)

Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
When I'm, when I'm lovin' you, lovin' you
Why would you wanna break up? Do anything for you
Why would you wanna break up?
See I be drivin' through your hood
Why would you wanna break up?
Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
When I'm, when I'm lovin' you, lovin' you
Why would you wanna break up? Do anything for you
Why would you wanna break up?
See I be drivin' through your hood
Why would you wanna break up?

Why would you, break up, break up, break up? Yeah
I'm back, baby
