High in the video, f*** with me, hella raw
Raw got a little riddle, riddle, twerk for a star
Started from the, like Christina, got a million
Man I'm a good guy, turned to a vill-I-an
Bully in the pack turned to a rat
P**** on my jack, I hit a b**** with a car bomb
Bombs in L.A., bombs in the Bay
N**** you ain't safe, I run with n****s like O-Dog
All we do is ball, all we do is ball, now I'm pa**ed out
Lean in the drop, ice in the watch
N****, that's Ben & Jerry dollars, watch a n**** make a stack house
Gingerbread man run while you can
All you n****s lame, tooly on me, got killers on speed dial
Infrared blam if a n**** shout
Don't get packed out, pro'ly hear the paparazzi when I back out

Can you see now? Are you senile?
Can you see now? You could see now?
Can you see now? Can you see now?
Can you see now? When you see a n****, don't be actin' senile

Sky dweller check, helicopter pad
Droppin' off a body bag
Money talk, guess I got the gift of gab
Don't interject, don't intercept
You ain't on a jet, you ain't meet a b**** with this kinda money yet
Yeah, I got an Audemar, I ain't set the time once
And I know they say they shine, I ain't seen 'em shine once
All these rappers is my sons, and I'm always nine months
Man if this was baseball, I ain't let 'em slide once
Do you see now? You playin' D now?
Oh, you wanna beat me, how?
Oh, you the number one draft in the league now?
Ride down ya block, doors twelve o'clock
Lambo, the drop, bike n****s, ain't stoppin' for a cop
I got this s*** locked tighter than a bear hug
When them b****es rap, n****s need an ear plug

Can you see now? Are you senile?
Can you see now? You could see now?
Can you see now? Can you see now?
Can you see now? When you see a n****, don't be actin' senile

Ride with the heat, trunk full of beat
Bomb like the Middle East, I got killers in the street

Ride with the heat, trunk full of beat
Bomb like the Middle East, I got killers in the street

Ride with the heat, trunk full of beat
Bomb like the Middle East, I got killers in the street

Ride with the heat, trunk full of beat
Bomb like the Middle East, I got killers in the street

N**** got a problem? See about it
Knock the n**** off, beat the body
I'm just makin' all these deposits
Neighborhood nice and quiet, thought I saw Mr. Rogers, n****
I could sell salt and equalize it, wait
I said I could sell salt and equalize it
Boy, I got every award but a Heisman
Do a drive by on you n****s, make a u-turn for survivors
Take a newborn from his momma, stick a shoe horn in vaginas
Got the coupe on Yokohamas, got the super soaker chopper
We'll kidnap the kingpin, like "Who is your supplier?"
N**** better know the fire, n**** better know somebody
I know n****s that'll kill yah for a little notoriety
I can make a lion say "Meow"
I'm in this mothaf***a gettin' money 'til I'm senile
Tunechi!
