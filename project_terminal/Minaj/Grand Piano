Am I just a fool?
Blind and stupid for loving you
Am I just a silly girl?
So young and naive to think you were
The one who came to take claim of this heart
Cold hearted shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark

And now the people are talking
The people are saying that you have been playing my heart
Like a grand piano
The people are talking
The people are saying that you have been playing my heart
Like a grand piano

So play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on

Am I being a fool?
Wrapped up in lies and foolish truths
What do I see in you?
Maybe I'm addicted to all the things you do
'Cause I keep thinking you were
The one who came to take claim of this heart
Cold hearted shame you'll remain just afraid in the dark
The people are talking
The people are saying that you have been playing my heart
Like a grand piano
The people are talking
The people are saying that you have been playing my heart
Like a grand piano

So play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on
