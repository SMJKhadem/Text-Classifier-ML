Banana boat full of blow,
Banana clip to cut ya throat
Banana dro come take a smoke
Banana diamonds yellow stone
Heavy snow that berry blow
That cherry coke got stupid dough

Hundred shows, I'm selling dope

Sippin' lean and burnin' piff, you
Gotta fifth I gotta pint you
Took a shot I took a sip
I plead the 5th ain't saying shit 
Go get my lawyer get him quick 
Spent 80 grand to beat a case I whipped it
Like my purple whip
I call a sit like Sosa did 
Them killas Blitz your house you monkey
I got so much jewelry on me still you can't take nothin' from me
Hook it up I cook it up and get some head while rollin' blunts
Water paint, water stain

Beamer truck I rim it up 
Spent 80 tho 400 stones
She suck a dick while rollin' blunt 
She keep the boss man bustin' nuts
I get it off she get it up me and her both can't get enough 
Me in the go I'm in the go so tryna beat that pussy up
