Let's go to the beach, each
Let's go get away
They say, what they gonna say?
Have a drink, clink, found the bud light
Bad b****es like me is hard to come by
The patron own, let's go get it on
The zone own, yes I'm in the zone
Is it two, three? Leave a good tip
I'ma blow off my money and don't give two s***s

I'm on the floor, floor
I love to dance
So give me more, more, 'til I can't stand
Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am

Star ships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Can't stop 'cause we’re so high
Let's do this one more time

Star ships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Can't stop
(We're higher than a motherf***er)
(We're higher than a motherf***er)
(We're higher than a motherf***er)

Bump in my hoopty-hoopty-hoop
I own that
And I ain't paying my rent this month
I owe that
But f*** who you want, and f*** who you like
Dance all ya life there's no end in sight
Twinkle, twinkle little star

Now everybody let me hear you say ray ray ray
Now spend all your money cause today pay day
And if you're a G, you a G-G-G
My name is Onika, you can call me Nicki

Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am

Star ships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Can't stop 'cause we’re so high
Let's do this one more time

Star ships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Can't stop
(We're higher than a motherf***er)
(We're higher than a motherf***er)
(We're higher than a motherf***er)

Star ships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Can't stop 'cause we’re so high
Let's do this one more time
