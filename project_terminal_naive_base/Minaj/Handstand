The Aphilliates nigga, holla at your boy
I know why you f*ck with me Nicki, you know what I am sayin' (holiday season)
'Cause we got the same type of shit in common
We like to get money (pay close, fuckin attention)

We-we-we-we like them boys with them rubber band bands
He-he-he-he move weight keep a couple gram, grams
So-so-so-so where your money put it in your hand, hands
Now-now-now-now make it flip make it do a handstand

We-we-we-we like them boys with them rubber band bands
He-he-he-he move weight keep a couple gram, grams
So-so-so-so where your money put it in your hand, hands
Now-now-now-now make it flip make it do a handstand

Do a handstand can you do a hand stand 
Flip that money make it do a handstand, 
I can make it scream like a summer jam fan where are my bands
Where my rubber band mans, my rubber bands mans

It's official bang your pistols 
Play your money it's funny I mean it tickles,
I need a d-boy I need a president 
And if your spendin' them stacks I need some evidence
Then you can bring out all them cars that they rap about
Then I'm a let you eat it like I put the snacks out,
Don't say you can't say you can say you can, can 
Flip that money flip it like a handstand

Do a handstand can you do a handstand
Flip that money make it do a handstand 
I can make it scream like a summer jam fan
Where are my bands where my rubber band mans

He's a banker by nature 
He'll call and slick of the debt that you owe and thank ya 
He'll switch the toys out never the same route
But niggas actin' like they ain't about to pay out
Takin' me out just to ask how my day went 
Tryna show me I'm his number one investment 
He know what I like, stay on your job type
I'll pop if you can pop like you got rubber bands we like

We-we-we-we like them boys with them rubber band bands
He-he-he-he move weight keep a couple gram, grams
So-so-so-so where your money put it in your hand, hands
Now-now-now-now make it flip make it do a handstand 

Do a handstand can you do a handstand
Flip that money make it do a handstand 
I can make it scream like a summer jam fan
Where are my bands where my rubber band mans
Cause we like them bad boys and bad cars
Them hood rich dope boys and trap stars 

'Cause we like them bad boys and bad cars
Them hood rich dope boys and trap stars

See I'm a rubber lover so wrap it and I'll hug ya
Then we can stick together like them dollars out the printer
Bad boys I catch call me undercover, 
Street grindin' cold cut motherfucker

Yo-yo-yo he flip like handstand he cookin' them 10 grams
Give him the grand slam in back of the phan dam
I mean the phantom I can't stand bums
Somethin' bout his money make a nigga handsome
Cuff-cuff throw ya badge on me
Guaranteed you can't puff puff pass on me
We can crush crush you can spend your stich on me
'Cause I know you want to smack it like a crash dummy

Do a handstand can you do a handstand
Flip that money make it do a handstand 
I can make it scream like a summer jam fan
Where are my bands where my rubber band mans (Aphelliates)
