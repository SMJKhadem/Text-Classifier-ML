Hey Barbie, ah, ah, ah, are you into black men?
He hey hey barbie! Hey I can be your black ken
Wow! cause' once you go black, you never go back
She wore her hair black, with curls in the back
Then she threw that ass back, back, back
Then I fell to the mat, and after that
Everything went black!

Baby one, two, three
Tell 'em get the referee
Cause he can, get the knockout
Pass the telephone please
Its an emergency
'Cause he can, get the knockout
Get the knockout

Hey Barbie, can I call you Barbra? ha ha
Hey Barbie! can I call you tomorrow, and today
'Cause once you go black, you never go back
And once you go Wayne, everybody else is whack
Then she threw that ass back, back, back,
Then I fell to the mat
And after that everything went back!

Baby one, two, three
Tell 'em get the referee
'Cause he can, get the knockout
Pass the telephone please
Its emergency
'Cause he can, get the knockout
Get the knockout

Awe f*ck it
Give me that damn bucket
Wh-when I throw this pussy
You better not start duckin'
Oh yo
How long with the blow
Lo-look out in the crowd
And everybody's yellin' no
Grab him by his locks
And get the message out the box
The head hit below the belt
I wanna give him good top
top, top
Give him good top
And if it hit below the belt
I wanna give him good top
One, two, three
They yellin' one, two, three
I done hit him with that motherfuckin' cunt two piece
Tell 'em, tell 'em the mop out
To late to cop out
Give him more head than toupees like I locked out

Baby one, two, three
Tell 'em get the referee
'Cause he can, get the knockout
Pass the telephone please
Its emergency
'Cause he can, get the knockout
Get the knockout
