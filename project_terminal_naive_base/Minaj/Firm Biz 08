Nicki Minaj:
Ya girl been hot since corduroys
Since quarter waters and all the boys
Used ta try to beat like corner boys
Cuz they heard the pussy wetter thsn them Dorney Rides
f*ck wat wit chu f*ck wit who
'long as them check clear like huxtables
I'm known to hang wit a thug or two
Niggaz that only do what a thug would do
Ask about me the feds watch dally
Gettin more cheese more bread than a deli
And I'm gettin love fan mail like melly
And i throw it up 12 o clock when i willy
Im in the air scoop my nigga j
Who gotta be craze
U gotta get paid
Aint nothing worst then being a broke bitch
i always got crack i tell em to smoke this

Jadakiss:
Yo ya boy been nice since thudercats
Since leather bombers and thumberjacks
Come outside wit a 100 sacks
Wot jeans wit the sweatpants under that
Front on who not on me
Niggaz know i put the 17 shot on me
Made a lil sumthin off rap a lot off D
Get ya points off another nigga not off me
Air forces new true's and a crispy Tee
New coupe nigga CL-63
Cost you nothin we get hit for free

Nicki Minaj:
So you wanna sip goose and play Nintendo wii no
Get the bricks and flip the ya yo

Feds getting dizzy niggaz tryna get me
So i change the sizzy combination to the cizzy
Brand new V thats wat i get for pitchin
Nice lil crib a couch that i culd sit in
Umm i mean sit on blow piff, f*ck a bitch on
Oops i mean feller keeps the umbrella
And i only f*ck wit them paper makers
