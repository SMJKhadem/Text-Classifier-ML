Pay attention, biatch (uh-huh)
Shouts out, Young Stephy the assistant (yeah)
Scotty the engineer, what up?
All my niggas throwin' it up on them bikes
I see you (the Aphilliates, nigga)
Nicki I told you I got you, baby
Gucci got you, baby
Weezy got you
We gon' hold you down, get 'em (Holiday Season)

She said, "F*ck Fendi" but I think she was playin'
I heard she move them thangs, I think she fuckin' Wayne
She call herself Lewinsky, that means she give him brain
She tryna be like Lil' Kim, her picture looks the same
Why she ain't signed with G-Unit, she from Queens, right?
And what's her nationality? She Chinese, right?
I mean she okay, but she ain't all that
She ain't the next bitch, tell that bitch fall back
See I'm a hater, I go hard, listen, let's begin
You know her last name Minaj? She a lesbian
And she ain't never comin' out, look at Curren$y
But every time she do an interview, you know I run and see
She get me so sick, it make me vomit
That's why I spend my time online, leaving comments
And you know, that I got some more haters with me, might hit up This Is 50
Mtv, hit up BET, tell 'em pretty, pretty please don't play Nicki

Still I rise, still I fight, still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize, see my haters, tell 'em, "Hi"
One day you'll remember this, one day when we reminisce
Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music biz

Still I rise, still I fight, still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize, see my haters, tell 'em, "Hi"
One day you'll remember this, one day when we reminisce
Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music biz
Nothing I do is good enough for you

Bitches is like crabs in a bucket
You see a bad bitch gettin' shine, you should love it
'Cause every time a door opens, for me that means you
Just got a better opportunity to do you
They don't understand, these labels look at numbers, it's statistics
I lose, you lose, ma, it's just logistics
Anyway, real bitches listen when I'm speakin'
'Cause if Nicki win, then all of y'all gettin' meetings, chyeah
Ask L.A. Reid, ask Jay
Then hit up Universal, see what Sylvia Rhone say
Ask Craig Kallman, you can ask Chris
Lighty, when you're done, just salute a bad bitch (chyeah)
Only underground bitch around that's ducking the paparazzi
In and outta town, be swervin' the Maserati
Stay around the white like a Nazi
Pussy p-p-popping on my poppers so the cops see, bitches

Still I rise, still I fight, still I might crack a smile (still I might)
Keep my eyes on the prize, see my haters, tell 'em, "Hi"
(I'ma keep my eyes on the price)
One day you'll remember this, one day when we reminisce (oh-oh-oh)
Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music biz (ah-ah-ah-ah)

Still I rise, still I fight, still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize, see my haters, tell 'em, "Hi" (tell 'em, Hi" for me)
One day you'll remember this, one day when we reminisce
Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music biz (oh when we reminisce)
(Remenisce, baby)
