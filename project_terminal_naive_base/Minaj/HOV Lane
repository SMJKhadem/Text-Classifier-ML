Zipping, I’m zipping, I’m zippin’
Soon as they come out, I’m dippin’
Big ass closet, I’m trippin’
Big booty strippers, I’m tippin’
Big ass chain, I’m heavy
And it didn’t cost me a penny
They pay me to rock it
Damn, I got niggas in pocket
Superbowl, Grammys
What a hell of a jammie!
All these bitches my sons
I’mma get ‘em a nanny
Argentina for Pepsi; Orlando All-Star
F*ck you said, bitch?; F*ck you, pornstar
I don’t do shotgun, I be driving my own car
I don’t do shots, neither, I’m buying the whole bar
Holy Moly, G copped me a Rolly
I ain't catchin' the puck but iced out like a goalie, nigga

I'm in the HOV lane
I'm in the HOV lane
And you, you, you? Soul Train

I travel more than you walking with a basketball
I'm out in Spain, running games with the El Matador
I'm in my own lane, you ain't in my categor
You like a Rav 4; I’m like the Aventador
Birkin bags, man I murk them ads
When I re-up on reloaded, I'mma hurt them bad
Every shoot is hot; when I'm out, I'm spotted
They gone frame the receipt if I sign the dotted
N-N-Niggas on Banshees is speedin’
Dirt bikes is out for the season
Back break wheelie and leanin’
Damn, a bitch late for a meetin’
NYPD comin’
Belt Parkway, we gunnin’
Double our engine hummin’
Acting a fool, we dumbin’

Nintendo and we in the end-zone
I don't give a f*ck ho
Like we in the friend zone
What the f*ck it look like
What the f*ck it's hitting fo'
Tell them bitches
You you ain't about that life!
