Ha, by popular demand Sasha Fierce, Nicki Minaj, let's go

Yo rude boy, why you cross me like a little T?
I'm Minaj, big M, uh'uh not a Mickey D
Now, I'm flyer than a broom, broom, I dissed him (broom)
Then I peel up in a room, boomin' system (room)
Now listen, now listen, listen
I was there through your bid in prison
Ya know, I coulda been your wife
But sucks for you, boo-hoo
I would never rent a tux for you
Excuse me, I'm buzzing like bumblebees
Football and they all wanna fumble me
I was a thirty-two D in my dungarees
Can I have a couple more cucumbers, please?
Now I'm that bitch, now I'm the bad witch
I need a lot of cheese up on my sandwich
Just got a new boyfriend, he's Pepe Le Pew
And he just bought me two Giuseppe shoes (thank you!)
That's one for right, and one for the left
Yes to the left, left, to the left
Now we should all go to Jerry Springer
And you could put the ring up on my middle finger

All the single ladies
And just like a ghost
You'll be gone, gone
Diddy bop, like Sean, John, John
Anyway, I like Lauren Lon-don
Get my chopsticks, get me my won-ton
'Cause you thought you'd win
But I'd knew you'd lose
Honey, I'm flyer than altitude crews
Yes, I'm cool, you can chuck deuce
Nicki been hot since duck, duck goose

All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

'Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
'Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it
