Uh look sucker, this my gun butter
Street fighter bitches, this the up cutter
Nun-chucker, no time to ducka'
Sign of the cross 'cause this is her last suppa'
Play with me, check who came with me
I bought a couple 9's, plus the K's with me
I breeze through Queen's to check some bad bitches
I stunt so hard, assess the damages
Cause this that aw, this is that aw
And yes I body bitches go get the bandages
Young yummy, f*ck you got from me
I hate a phony bitch that front that chum chummy
I'm me top shotta' drop the top toppa'
Big fat pussy with a icy watch

I am your leader, yes I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick

When I fly, it's one letter and one number
You act hoes could get hot for one summer
After that the queen will still reign here,
I'm Santa Clause to these hoes without a reindeer
Saint Nick, Ross, hey Rick, I just got a toy, cost 850
Now I'm in the hood, niggas is getting woodies
Hit the hot topic, Nicki Minaj hoodie
I'm a brand bitch I'm a brand
Go to Harlem, and get Cam
It's Dipset, get your dick wet
Boarded the big jet, and got a big check
Now you tell me, who the f*ck is winning
I'm on my Russel Simmons, Nicki denim, Nicki leanin'

I am your leader, yes I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick

Jealous niggas is gossip, watch me tie up my laces (huh)
Bitches be jocking, tell by the look on they faces
8 digits I'm clocking, a lot of gold in my bracelet
7 figures on watches, I told my mama I made it
Made a deal for my project, just give me 10 mill I'm gravy
I went back to the projects, and two mill in Mercedes
I get head from your lady, have her bill me later
I'm on school with the hustle, just gave Rihanna my pager
Heart break hotel, I'm in the 8 rise suite
Rolls Royce wood, I'm talking playoff seat
Know that boy busy balling I like to play all week
Monday night with the raw, I'm Vince McMahon with a beat
Power slamming them hammers I get you handle for free
So where the f*ck is her manners, she gives me brain while I tweet
DM, in the BM, you CM, you bucking, you love it
Motherfuckers on my dick, suck it

I am your leader, yes I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick

See the car is European but got imported from Tokyo
Looking like a shark, the nose call it Pinocchio
Well off, wealthy, LV, logo
Middle of July but the wrist on snowflow
Only do the Aspens, y'all can have the Poconos
I'm sunny and you must suck collagen dose, Calogero
Ride the whip, 5 on the hip, live with the pies got 9 for the flip
High with a bitch, she cry for the dick, oh my know why I'm fly as it gets
Now I need an aspirin
She said "You're only Cam'ron,
Girlfriend you don't know Cam'ron from nowhere
So don't go tampering, you're just a nail I hammer
'Nother girl that's on my camera
My name you cannot slander at all girl, watch your manners
She run and tell her mama, "I think I love him, Nana."
Because you sat upon my lap?
Nah, I ain't Santa hope they call me my piper, OJ no glove I knife her
Never be a lifer, even do right
Why would I fight her? Donâ€™t even like her

I am your leader, yes I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick
I am your leader, yes I am your leader
You're not a believer, suck a big dick
