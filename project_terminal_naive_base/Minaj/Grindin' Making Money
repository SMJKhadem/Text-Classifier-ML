This my nine-to-five
Still livin' all that I like
Grindin' makin' money
Grindin' makin' money
Grindin' makin' money
Grindin' makin' money

I grind all day, gettin money
Damn, it take all day to count the money
I'm in the freezer, neck full of icicles
I'm a dime, you other chicas need a nickel
Who that in the phantom? (kimmy)
Or maybe in that Maserati or that S1-50
Or in that Bugatti, you can't f*ck with me
I do this for my niggas on the grind
And never be another me
What, you out your mind?
I get it poppin' when it's money on the line
Damn, I dropped the house on my wrist for the shine
Louboutin, Fendi, Dior all the time
I snitched in the Louis store, yeah I dropped the dime
Got baby and big daddy slim on the line
The way that we ball, I'm sayin' is a crime
But we don't really care, I continue gettin mine
Cause this my nine-to-five

All day
This my nine-to-five
Still livin' all that I like
Grindin' makin' money
Grindin' makin' money
Grindin' makin' money

All day
This my nine-to-five
Still livin' all that I like
Grindin' makin' money
Grindin' makin' money
Grindin' makin' money
Grindin' makin' money

Back on my stunna shit
Flyer with a extra clip
Flyer in the new whip
Ball hard the matchin' whip
Keep my shorty with me shit
Make sure she flip that shit
Ride around deliver shit
Get some of this money shit
Hustle all the time and she shine when we hit the bitch
Ball every night in the club like we do this shit
Uptown soldier, know how I roller
Brought a tour overseas now she all over
Hurricane hit that bitch
Now we had to do that shit
Bounce right back in my hood with some new shit
Everyday sunshine, keep my tool all the time
Blowin' out the pound everyday, the money on the grind

All day
This my nine-to-five
Still livin' all that I like
Grindin' makin' money
Grindin' makin' money
Grindin' makin' money

Ay yo
Eenie-meenie-minie-moe
I'm pi-pi-pickin' hoes
To pucker up and kiss my ass under the mistletoe
Yes, I am about my cake, just call me ani-man
I keep a gentleman, first nine, Benjamin
Don't mess with Washington
Don't mess with Abraham
Pattycake, pattycake, better get the bakers, man
Frosted flakes is on my fingers, Fruity Loops is on my wrist
Fruity Pebble Barbie pendant, don't forget to ice my kiss
Now where my girls at?
That stack money
That young money
That cash money
I work the red carpet, you clean the red carpet
Go get your vaccum don't you get me started

All day
This my nine-to-five
Still livin' all that I like
Grindin' makin' money
