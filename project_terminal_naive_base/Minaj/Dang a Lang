Excuse me, can I see your danglin', brother?
I mean, you know, juggle your balls like the Ringling Brothers
I'm the Harajuku Barbie, I ain't trippin' on your change
I mean, look, I got the sports package on my Range
I just did, did the pink for the pink effect
D-D-D-Diamonds on my neck for the link effect
And I was wonderin' if I could lip-sync on that
You know my name ring, ring Tinkerbells
W-W-W-Watch (check)
Chain (check)
They be on the rain (check)
I be on the move, they be reachin' but they can't catch
I'm with the baddest bitch on the island stylin'
Black Miley Cyrus, sayin' hi to pirates
I be singin' them ballads when he tossin' my salad
When I pet my parrot, all you see is colorful carrots
I be singin' them ballads when he tossin' my salad
When I pet my parrot, all you see is colorful carrots

I got a watch (I got a watch), I got a chain (I got a chain)
I got a whole bunch of money in the bank
I just want him for his dang a lang
I just want him for his dang a lang
I got a car (got a car), big house (big house)
And when I'm done then I kick his ass out
I just want him for his dang a lang
I just want him for his dang a lang
