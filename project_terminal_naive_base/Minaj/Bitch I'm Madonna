We hit the elevator right up to the rooftop
The bass is pumping
Make me wanna screw the top off
Yeah, we'll be drinking, and nobody's gonna stop us
And we'll be kissing anybody that's around us

I just wanna have fun tonight
(Blow up this shit tonight)
Pull me out of the flashing light
Ohh ohh ohh ohh

(Gonna blow up!)

We go hard or we go home

We get freaky if you want
Na na na na
We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch I'm Madonna (Bitch I'm Madonna) (Bitch I'm Madonna)

We're jumping in the pool and swimming with our clothes on
I brought a pee-wee to my show and got my freak on
The neighbors pissed and says he's gonna call the Five-O
If that's your weapon we are gon' give a good show

I just wanna go hard tonight
Pull me out of the flashing light
Ohh ohh ohh ohh

Who do you think you are?
You can't miss this, this lucky star
Ohh ohh ohh ohh
Who do you think you are

Pulled up with my nose up
And that rose up in that thanga
I'm froze up, but my stove up
'Cause he eatin' like this his dinner
I run shit, I don't fall back
'Cause I'm on track, I'm a sprinter
I'm bossed up, I got em all struck
It's not a toss up, I'm the winner
Beep beep, bitch move
'Fore I bang bang with that Uz
That's Miu Miu on my shoes
Ain't got a thing left for me to prove
It's that bottle service all night
It's that poppin' urban just right
It's that go hard or go home zone
Bitch, I'm Madonna, these hoes know

We go hard or we go home
We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na na na na

We gon do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
