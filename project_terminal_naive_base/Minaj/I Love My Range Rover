((?) on the track)

She's so pretty
She know they want her but
She's so sididdy
They can't afford her but
All the boys there when she comes around my way
Straight out the driveway head to the highway
Red light, green light, got the best moves
Headlights beam bright got the best boobs
I call her double R, my rough rider
We hit a couple malls then I remind her
'Cause on the road of life she is the spokesmodel
Her body tighter than a coke bottle

She super charge cars anything for Minaj
And she could only park in the superstar garage
'Cause she-she-she-she bad (bad) if anybody ask (ask)
Her bags is boss 'cause her leather so soft
If it ain't of been softer tell 'em raise the offer
Used to f*ck with a yellow bitch named Porsche
N-N-Now it's me and her (yeah) she say it's you Minaj
Red underneath her shoe, that's Louboutins

La-la-la-la-la-la-la, (la-la-la) la-la-la-la-la-la-la (la-la-la-la-la)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, (la-la-la) la-la-la-la-la-la-la (la-la-la-la-la)
I love my, I love my, I love my Range Rover
I love my Range Rover, l-l-l-love my Range Rover
I love my, I love my, I love my Range Rover
I love my Range Rover, l-l-l-love my Range Rover

P-P-Pumps on the gas 140 on the dash
On the dash, on the dash on the d-d-d-d-ash
P-P-Pumps on the gas 140 on the dash
On the dash, on the dash on the d-d-d-d-ash

She's so dope (mhm)
You know she even help me transport the dope (okay)
That mama stay around that white like the pope
They get the canine but they can't smell the coke (oh)
Now you tell me why is it (yeah)
Now you tell me why is it (yeah)
Don't need the Riker's visit
That is because I'm about the colour of the Gecko lizard (oh)
She L-Lewinsky hold ya bosses
Come around town 300 horses
Power she devour got them gettin' divorces
I don't stop for officers

And now we hit hydraulics
That's for the left turn
We dive the piece she got more horses than a western
You know she beat weight so she don't eat late
A vegetarian and she sippin' on that V8

They try to gas her, they try to put it in her
You can't pass her, she faster than a TV dinner
Her liquors poppin'
We call it Armor All
We chuck the deuces up

La-la-la-la-la-la-la, (la-la-la) la-la-la-la-la-la-la (la-la-la-la-la)
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, (la-la-la) la-la-la-la-la-la-la (la-la-la-la-la)
I love my, I love my, I love my Range Rover
I love my Range Rove, l-l-l-love my Range Rover
I love my, I love my, I love my Range Rover
I love my Range Rove, l-l-l-love my Range Rover

P-P-Pumps on the gas 140 on the dash
On the dash, on the dash on the d-d-d-d-ash
P-P-Pumps on the gas 140 on the dash
On the dash, on the dash on the d-d-d-d-ash
