What seems to be the trouble
Are we feeling out of sorts
Do you think they're gone forever
Can you show me where it hurts
I think I know what's wrong
A lot people get this way
Take two of these four times a day
I'll drop in when I pass this way again
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever

My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
You have to pull yourself together
You have to take it like a man
You mustn't let it get your head down
You should go out and do the town
There's no good moping here alone
Feeling sorry for yourself
Go and see what you can find
It's saturday night and you should unwind
