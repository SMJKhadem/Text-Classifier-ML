I am a little unstable
Loose wires always getting tangled now
I am a little bit difficult
I can be a little self-critical now
I am a little unable
To put all my cards on the table now
But somehow You're still with me

It's amazing that You can
Love me like I am
And even when I can't
You still love me as I am
Oh, I don't know how You do it
And I know I put You through it
Yeah, it's amazing that You can
Love me like I
Love me like I

Am, ooh
You love me like I
Am, ooh
You love me like I
Am

I am a little uneven
In need of a little more healing now
Yes, I am (yes, I am)
And I feel a little unfixable
You're nothing short of a miracle now
'Cause somehow You're still with me

It's amazing that You can
Love me like I am
And even when I can't
You still love me as I am
Oh, I don't know how You do it
And I know I put You through it
Yeah, it's amazing that You can
Love me like I
Love me like I

Am, ooh
You love me like I
Am, ooh
You love me like I
Am, ooh
You love me like

It's amazing that You can
Love me like I am
Even when I can't
You still love me as I am
Yeah, I don't know how You do it
And I know I've put You through it
Yeah, it's amazing that You can
Love me like I
Love me like I am
