F*ck all that, we've got to get on with these
(F*ck all that, f*ck all that)
Got to compete with the wily Japanese
There's too many home fires burning and not enough trees
(F*ck all that)
So f*ck all that, we've gotta get on with these
(Gotta get on with these)

Can't stop, lose job
Mind gone, silicon
Stroll on what bomb?
Get away, payday
Make hay, break down
Need fix, big six
Click, click
Hold on, oh no
Bingo (bingo)

Make 'em laugh, make 'em cry
Make 'em dance in the aisles
Make 'em pay, make 'em stay
Make them feel okay

Not now John, we've got to get on with the film show
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)
Hollywood waits at the end of the rainbow
(End of the rainbow)
Who cares what it's about as long as the kids go
(As long as the kids go)
So, not now John, we've gotta get on with the show
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)

(Gotta get on, gotta get on, gotta get on)

Hang on John I've gotta get on with this
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)
Don't know what it is, but it fits on here like, sss
Come at the end of the shift, we'll go and get pissed
But not now John, I've gotta get on with this
(Gotta get on with this, gotta get on)

Hold on John, I think there's something good on
I used to read books but
Could be the news or some other abuse
Could be reusable shows

F*ck all that, we've gotta get on with these
Gota compete with the wily Japanese
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)
No need to worry about the Vietnapeace
Gota bring Russian Bear to his knees
(Gotta get on)
Well, maybe not the Russian Bear, maybe the Swedes
We showed Argentina, now let's go and show these
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)
Make us feel tough and wouldn't Maggie be pleased?

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
(Na, na, na, na, na, na, na)
(One, two, Free Four)
(One, two, Free Four)

S'cusi, dov'è il bar? (What?) (gotta get on)
Se parakalo, pou einai to bar?
S'il vous plaît, où est le bar? (Say it in English, fairy)
Oi, where's the fucking bar John? (Oh, now you're talking)
(Rule Britannia, Britannia rules the day) (gotta get on, gotta get on)
Down (gotta get on)
Go, Maggie
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)
Hammer, Hammer, Hammer, Hammer, now
