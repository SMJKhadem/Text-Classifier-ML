Shall we buy a new guitar? 
Shall we drive a more powerful car? 
Shall we work well through the night? 
Shall we get into fights
Leave the lights on
Drop bombs, in the east
Contract diseases
Bury treasures, store up
Lights on, drop bombs
In the east, contract diseases
Bury treasures, store up
Lights on, drop bombs
In the east, contract diseases
Bury treasure, store up leisure
And never relax at all

With our backs to the wall
With our backs to the wall
With our backs to the wall
With our backs to the wall
With our backs to the wall
With our backs to the wall
With our backs to the wall
With our backs to the wall
With our backs to the wall
