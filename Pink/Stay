Stay! 
And help me to end the day
And if you don’t mind
We’ll break a bottle of wine
Stick around 
And maybe we’ll put one down
'Cause I wanna find 
What lies behind those eyes

Midnight blue
Burning gold
A yellow moon
Is growing cold

I rise
Looking through my morning eyes
Surprised 
To find you by my side
Rack my brain 
And try to remember your name
To find 
The words to tell you good-bye

Morning dues
Newborn day
Midnight blue
Turned to gray

Midnight blue
Burning gold
A yellow moon
Is growing cold
