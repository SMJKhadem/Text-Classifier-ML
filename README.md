# Text-Classifier-ML
In this project, I build a text classification model on song lyrics. The task is to predict the artist from a piece of text. To train such a model, you first need to collect your own lyrics dataset:
Download a HTML page with links to songs
Extract hyperlinks of song pages
Download and extract the song lyrics
Vectorize the text using the Bag Of Words method
train a classification model that predicts the artist from a piece of text
refactor the code into functions
Write a simple command-line interface for the program
